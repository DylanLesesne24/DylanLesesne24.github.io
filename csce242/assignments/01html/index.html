        <h2>The Motherboard</h2>
        <p>
            The motherboard is the main circuit in a computer system. It acts as the core platform that connects everything internally. This includes the computer's memory, processor, graphics cards and other parts. It not only allows these components to communicate, but also provides them with power. This ensures the computer operates as one complete unit. The motherboard is also respinsible for linking the various pieces that make up the hardware ecosystem. It contains many different connections and sockets, such as RAM and CPU slots. There are also expansion ports that allow additional hardware to be added. Through these connections, data travels and power is shared across the system. Without the motherboard, the indivudal components could not work together effectively.

                <td>Micro-ATX</td>
                <td>A smaller version of ATX. It usually has fewer expansion slots but is more compact and affordable, good for budget or office computers.</td>
            <tr>
                <td>Mini-ITX</td>
                <td>Very small motherboards used in compact PCs. They usually have only one expansion slot and limited RAM slots, but theyâ€™re great for small form factor builds.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>E-ATX (Extended ATX)</td>
                <td>Larger than ATX, often used for workstations and high-end gaming setups because it supports extra RAM slots and multiple GPUs.</td>
